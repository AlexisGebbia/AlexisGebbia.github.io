/**
 * Keith O'Hara <kohara@bard.edu>
 * July 2016
 * ported ELIZA (https://github.com/dhconnelly/paip-python) to javascript;
 * from that program:
 * 
 *  "Eliza is a pattern-matching automated psychiatrist. Given a set
 *   of rules in the form of input/output patterns, Eliza will attempt
 *   to recognize user input phrases and generate relevant
 *   psychobabble responses.
 * 
 *   Each rule is specified by an input pattern and a list of output
 *   patterns. A pattern is a sentence consisting of space-separated
 *   words and variables. Input pattern variables come in two forms:
 *   single variables and segment variables; single variables (which
 *   take the form ~x) match a single word, while segment variables
 *   (which take the form ~*x) can match a phrase. Output pattern
 *   variables are only single variables. The variable names contained
 *   in an input pattern should be the same as those in the
 *   corresponding output pattern, and each segment variable ~*x in an
 *   input pattern corresponds to the single variable ~x in the output
 *   pattern.
 *
 *   The conversation proceeds by reading a sentence from the user,
 *   searching through the rules to find an input pattern that
 *   matches, replacing variables in the output pattern, and displaying
 *   the results to the user."
